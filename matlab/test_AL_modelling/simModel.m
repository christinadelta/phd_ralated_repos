% MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MODEL:

% Part of Parameter Recovery Process. 

% For inferences about volatility and stochasticity and about the true
% reward/loss rate we are using the stc-vol model that jointly estimates
% stochasticity and volatility using the kalman (to estimate x) and
% particle (to estimate stc and vol) filters.

% Mathematical Formulation: The model uses specific applications of 
% Bayes' rule, representing beliefs about the reward rate at each step as 
% a Gaussian distribution with a mean and variance. This formulation leads 
% to a rationale for the error-driven update (a prominent concept in 
% neuroscience and psychology) and accounts for the learning rate, 
% which depends on the agent's uncertainty
% 
% Kalman Filter Foundation: The model begins with a Kalman filter, which 
% is optimal for learning from noisy data. It assumes that inferences are 
% drawn from observations corrupted by two types of noise: process noise 
% (volatility) and outcome noise (stochasticity). Volatility refers to 
% how quickly the true value being estimated changes, while stochasticity 
% describes additional noise in the observation of each outcome
% 
% Probabilistic Model Development: To handle the complexities of 
% simultaneous estimation of volatility and stochasticity, the model uses 
% particle filtering, a standard approximation approach. This method 
% allows for tractable inference for the reward rate, replacing the true 
% values of stochasticity and volatility with their corresponding samples
% 
% Learning Rate Dependence: The model underscores that volatility 
% increases the learning rate while stochasticity reduces it. Learning 
% both parameters simultaneously is critical for efficient learning due 
% to their opposite effects on the learning rateâ€‹
