function feedback = computeFeedback(trlvec, prob, round, volatility, task)

% adapted from NS getOutcomeDist.m 
% inputs: 
%           - trlvec = trials vector (e.g., 1:100)
%           - prob = high or low rewarded probability to be used to generate feedback sequence
%           - round = [if 1 = feedback sequence generation is stochastic (like all tutorials), if 0 = sequence is fixed based on the number of trials for high and low rewarded trials]      
%           - volatility [1x1 double, needed for the generation of the feedback sequence
%           - task (if 1 = in stable condition there is a switch of
%           reward probabilities and the stimuli after half trials)
